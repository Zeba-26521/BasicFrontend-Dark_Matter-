    <h1>Dark Matter</h1>
    <p> Dark matter is still a mystery. It has not yet been seen or observed directly. It doesn’t make any kind of interaction with light, it doesn’t emit, retract light so it can’t be detected by observing electromagnetic radiation. You might think if it is unseen then how did we get to know about its existence,actually its presence is implied in a variety of astrophysics observations, including gravitational effects that cannot be explained by accepted theories of gravity unless more matter is present than can be seen.
